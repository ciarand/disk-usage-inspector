Disk Usage Inspector
====================
A very simple disk usage inspector CLI written in PHP with help from the Symfony Console.

Building
--------
If you don't already have the wonderful [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) script, you can install it locally by running:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Or globally by running:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=bin
```

To build this project:
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:ciarand/disk-usage-inspector.git disk-usage-inspector
# Move into the project directory
cd disk-usage-inspector
# Install any dependencies
# If you have composer installed globally
composer install
# If you have composer installed locally
php composer.phar install
```
